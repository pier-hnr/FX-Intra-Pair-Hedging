Mathematical Framework for Intra-Pair Hedging in Automated Trading Systems
==========================================================================

This paper develops a vector-space formulation for intra-pair hedging that enables consistent computation of hedge sizes across positions with different drawdown profiles. The framework provides formal existence and uniqueness proofs for optimal hedge solutions under standard conditions, with an explicit closed-form formula enabling direct computation with algorithmic complexity suitable for real-time application. The methodology includes tunable parameters for controlling coverage and concentration, offering fine-grained control over the risk-return trade-off through a transparent and quantitatively justified approach.

The proposed framework offers quantifiable advantages over ad-hoc methods by providing exact targeting of desired risk reduction levels and optimizing efficiency through concentration on positions contributing most to portfolio risk. For practitioners, this provides a systematic method to determine which positions to hedge and in what proportions, with transparent mathematical justification for each decision. The approach facilitates communication with stakeholders by providing a quantitative basis for risk management decisions and enables stress-testing of portfolio resilience under different hedging scenarios.

Work is ongoing to incorporate confidence intervals for drawdown estimates and develop robust optimization methods for worst-case risk minimization.
