# FX-Intra-Pair-Hedging
This paper presents a rigorous mathematical framework for intra-pair hedging in automated FX trading systems. Using vector space theory, we derive explicit formulas for computing optimal hedge sizes that target precise risk reduction levels. The framework identifies minimal position subsets contributing most to portfolio drawdown.
